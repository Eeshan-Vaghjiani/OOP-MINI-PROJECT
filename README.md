# Calculator Project

The Calculator project contains three main files,`Main.java`, `CalculatorGUI.java` and `Calculator.java`.

## Main.java

`Main.java` is the main entry point for the application. It instantiates and displays the `CalculatorGUI` frame.

## CalculatorGUI.java

`CalculatorGUI` is a Java Swing GUI application that provides a graphical interface for users to input mathematical expressions and see the result.

### Features:
- Evaluates mathematical expressions, including parentheses, basic arithmetic, and scientific functions.
- Built with Java Swing for the GUI.
- Implements the ActionListener interface to handle button actions.
- Customizes font, color, and size for the GUI elements.

### Instructions:
- The user interface consists of a JTextField for input and result display and JButtons for various operations.
- Buttons include numeric digits, basic arithmetic operators, mathematical functions, parentheses, and more.

### Usage:
- Clone the repository.
- Compile and run `CalculatorGUI.java`.

## Calculator.java

`Calculator` is a utility class that implements the `BasicCalculator` interface for evaluating mathematical expressions.

### Features:
- Handles basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Supports exponentiation, square root, and cube root.
- Implements unary plus and minus, parentheses, and implicit multiplication.

### Usage:
- No user interaction.
- `Calculator` is used internally by `CalculatorGUI` to evaluate mathematical expressions entered by the user.
